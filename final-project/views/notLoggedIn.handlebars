<p> XXX is a web application that empowers users to better manage their money and easily contribute to the causes they care about the most. By parsing the user’s purchases using Capital One’s API, the application will then round purchases up to the nearest dollar, determine the total amount to be donated to charity, and presents that to the user in the form of an easy-to-read list and a pie chart that break down the charitable contributions by charity and date. Once the total reaches a specific threshold, say $10, the amount will be pushed to the charity via Google’s charity API. </p>
